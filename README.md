# Kiezburn Calendar Parser

Convert raw text from the PDF generated by the [dust](https://dust.events/dust) app, into `.ics` file you can import into your calendar app.

## Steps

In short the steps are:

1. **Prepare the input**: Open the `input.txt` and paste the text you copied from the PDF, then fix formatting.
2. **Run the parser**: `main.py`
3. **Import to calendar**: Use the generated `kiezburn_events.ics` file

That's it. Hopefully it works for you.

Here are more detailed instructions:

## 1. The input


Open the `input.txt` and paste the text you copied from the PDF.
(I copied the text using the edge pdf viewer, it could be that other PDF viewers copy the text differently, but hopefully they still work.)

Your `input.txt` should follow this format:

```
Events
 Tuesday 29th
 1pm
 Kiez name
 Event name
 7pm
 Kiez name
 Event name
 Wednesday 30th
 10am
 Kiez name
 Event name
...
```

It should say `Events` at the top.

Then a date like "Tuesday 29th", "Wednesday 30th", etc.

Then always 3 lines consisting of
1. time of the event
2. organizing Kiez
3. event name


It's not a problem if emojies are in the text, but they might have broken the formatting, so check the file and make sure that it's always has this formatting.

Some events that don't have a organizing Kiez listed might break the formatting. In that case just add `xxx` or so, to that line. Just make sure that each event always fills up 3 lines.


Your file should look something like this.

```
Events
 Tuesday 29th
 5pm
 The one Stage
 Fun Shimmying
 7pm
 Magical Realm
 Trivia quiz
 8:30pm
 The only Haus
 Lip Sync Show
 Wednesday 30th
 12pm
 xxx
 Human Curling
 5am
 Harlem Haus
 Harlem Opening Ceremony
```


Then you can close and save the file.

## 2. Run the parser

You need to run : `python main.py` in the command line or terminal, while being located in the folder where the `main.py` file is located.

Or using a program like VSCode, you can click the play button in the top right corner that runs the file.

Now you should see some outputs that look something like this:

```
üé™ Kiezburn Calendar Parser
========================================
üìä SUMMARY
========================================
‚úì Processed 7 dates
‚úì Total events: 23
...
```

## 3. Import to calendar

Now you should have two files in the folder:

The `events.json` file you can just ignore. You should download the `kiezburn_events.ics` file, then you can import it into your calendar app.


## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No additional packages required


*I hope this works for you*
